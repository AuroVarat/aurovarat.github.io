[{"id":1637193600,"title":"Obstacle Avoidance Robot with IR Sensor","author":"Auro","date":"November 18, 2021","content":"In this project, a KY-032 IR avoidance sensor is used to guide a robot car to prevent collisions with obstacles. The car is driven using two front wheels, controlled independently and bidirectionally using L293DNE motor driver chip. An uncontrolled third wheel was used to balance the chassis on the rear. The direction of movement is controlled by using a tank steering system with the front wheels.The response time for the car to an obstacle is found to be about 0.17s. The distance it travels during the response time is about 19(1) mm. The range of obstacle detection is also found to vary depending on the nature of surface of the obstacle. \n\n\n[Read full report here](https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s1905547_ed_ac_uk/EVHGqw-Yo7dClN3-NZwrVPUBh2IGyUrMV2P3Jy5hhrnTrw?e=Dkp3VE)"},{"id":1627772400,"title":"Reliably sizing particles in Multi-modal Suspension","author":"Auro","date":"August 01, 2021","content":"<b>Numerous conventional techniques are available to calculate particle size distributions in colloidal suspensions. However, to achieve any reliable statistics, the methods are limited to mono-modal suspensions. A new technique, Differential Dynamic Microscopy(DDM) is explored in search for a reliable method to study multimodal suspension.
