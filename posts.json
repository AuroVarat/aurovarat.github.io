However, to achieve any reliable statistics, the methods are limited to mono-modal suspensions. A new technique, Differential Dynamic Microscopy(DDM) is explored in search for a reliable method to study multimodal suspension. The experiment considers Bi-modal polystyrene suspension under Laser Diffraction, Scanning Electron microscopy and DDM. The obtained data are compared to understand the limitations of each method.</b>  \n<br>\n\nThe experiment aimed at finding the size distribution of Polystyrene suspension in waterusing three different techniques, namely - Scanning Electron Microscopy, Laser Diffrac-tion Particle analyzer and Direct Differential microscopy.   Then comparing the resultsobtained to judge the reliability of the methods for bi-modal suspensions of known con-centration by weight.\n\n[Read full report here](https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s1905547_ed_ac_uk/EcMJeXtDfCRCquqHvlJwWL4BHdUDad8hbpqqhoPjAyC4YA?e=FSGWFe)"}]
